# hello-world
First introductory repository

Hello world, just figuring out how this thing works I guess, play around, take your baby steps, explore more and learn and eventually it's like second nature, and you're on the path to achieving mastery.

That is the goal, mastery in all aspects of what I commit to. I have the capability, it's about pushing myself. I can do this. I can focus on this. I can achieve my goals. I can do it.

Ps. I might love Nargis. I don't know how I feel. How can I come to terms with my feelings for this girl? I don't even know how I let her into my heart, but here we are. Anyways, lets go. Back to focusing on me. Just keep working and thinking and achieving, everything will fall into place on it's own.
